# object-detection-
single object detection for electronic cards using transfert learning and regression
the dataset used in this project can be download from this link https://www.kaggle.com/tannergi/microcontroller-detection
the idea of this project is to provide some simple techniques to use for localization and recognition of one object 
by training using transfer learning with low computational time 
before going to more complex project to detect multi-object detection  using some existing framework such YOLO ,SSD 
One example of model as shown in the .ipynb file can be used to train from scratch
