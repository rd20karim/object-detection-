# object-detection-
single object detection for electronic cards using transfert learning and regression
the dataset used in this project can be download from this link https://www.kaggle.com/tannergi/microcontroller-detection
the idea of this project is to provide some simple techniques to use for localization and recognition of one object 
by training from scratch before going to more complex project to detect multiobject using some existing framework such YOLO ,SSD
